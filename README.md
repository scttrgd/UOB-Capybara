# Capybara based tests

These tests can all be run either locally or using the preconfigured Selenium Grid at aneurin1.bath.ac.uk:

### Prereqs: 
- Ruby - This is the language that the tests are written in (the newest version is always best to go for) https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/
- Ruby Bundler - This manages the versions and specific ruby packages that are installed
  - gem install bundler
- Run Bundle install in the specific test directory (ensure you can see a 'features' directory)
